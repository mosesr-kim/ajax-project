## Motive

At the time, I was an avid stock trader and loved to keep track of my favorite stocks to see how they were doing daily.
I would always check the current price, today's highs and lows, and the percentage change whether it was up or down.
I wanted to build an application I was passionate about while using newly profound skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The Yahoo Finance API was rich in data but also limited requests to 500 per month. I made use of the limitation by building my app around a single API request.
